Today, we're going to discuss a bit about algorithms nd what exactly they are. We're going to change gears a bit and start looking outside of search engines and moreso into big data. In the case of Google, this is how it personalizes our search results. We're going to look at some of the dangers of algorithms and where they go wrong. When we're being targeted, what is being left out? What are the assumptions of algorithms? 

## So Far:
We've been looking at Google, how it ranks things, how it designs search results for us, how it categorizes results, and how it advertises. We often find that there is an illusion of reliability in these results. Is there some kind of implicitly suggested liability into that? 

The reading for the first week by hathanon often brings up that we trust it becuase it's almost like it's reading our thoughts. It caters to us based on previous histories. Today it's going to be thinking about algorithms.

One of the things we can start to think about in relation to this week's readings, is that we live in this world of algorithms. This term from computer science has moved itself into our every-day experiences. More and more of our everyday life is being mediated by these algorithms (ie, job candidacy, etc.).

We are often exposed to these algorithms without us knowing, for example the idea of killer robots, etc. How they lead to tensions and conflicts within society. ruining elections, digital extremeisms, etc. One of the things Kathy O'Neil mentions is that we are often warned about algorithms
