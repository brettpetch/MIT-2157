## Where We Left off:
- What exactly did you find with how search engines arranged results.
    - Searches are more personalized on Google; if you search "vaccine" 

## The Ranking Algorithm
Obviously, there is quite a bit at play. The big question is in what order do the results of a search engine appear? In particular, what results are going to appear in the first page? If you are moved from the first page to the 5th page, there will be (possibly) millions of dollars at play.

### Relevance
The way the ranking algorithm determines relevance by 
- words in documents
    - Term frequency
    - Inverse Document Frequency
    - The position of words in the document
    - Evidence of highlighted words
- Links, especially the words in the 'anchor text'

#### Example: Review of Cats
- measuring the inverse document frequency
    - amount of term used, document freequency, 4/200 = 0.02
    - the count of total indexed words
##### Analysis of inbound links:
- excerpt from another movie review site
> "I just recently read a really great and scathing [review of the new movie cats]()
- identifies what that result is. 

### Quality
