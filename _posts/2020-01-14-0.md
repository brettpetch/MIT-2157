1. Technology: The use of computer programs to store, analyze and compare large data sets
2. Analysis: Drawing on large datasets to find patterns in order to make social claims
3. Mythology: the widespread belief that large datasets can generate insights that were previously impossible, and are perceived to be true and objective.
