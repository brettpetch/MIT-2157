Midterm will be handed back next week. Alot of people still need to write makeups, but it's slightly different. More info will be provided soon.

There is a final written assignment due last class, originally was going to bring it in today, but will bring it in on Thursday.

## This week: 
How are we identified, analyzed and targeted in the era of big data?
More importantly, what are the implications of this?

## Question: 
When you use new apps or programs, do you trust them with your data? Are there times when you avoid using theme just because of data concerns?

- TikTok: overlooked because popularity
- Snapchat: Filters, collecting data on faces
- Things being a base for a phone: depth scan of face
- Defeatism: surveillance revelations from Edward Snowden
- If you get inerrant value, people tend to not question it.

Our data is constantly being collected, living in a surveillance structure. 

John Cheney-Lippold: 
> our identity is tracked and collected by an interconnected surveillance structure than analyses our personal information. 

Our data double says something about who we are. Our information can be wrong. Since it is a datafied version of who we are, it attempts to make somekind of image. What kind of image is presented by me? It creates this data double. Cheney calls this a new algorithmic identity

> "An identity formation that works through mathematical algorithms to infer categories of identity on otherwise anonymous beings. It uses statistical commonality models to determine one's gender, class, or race in an automatic manner at the time as it defines the actual maning of gender, class, or race themselves" 
- (165)

Looking at a group, we can create a new identity on all of this information. Sites use data mining tools to amass and save all kinds of data and using data analytics and machine learning to analyze and extract useful information and patterns. Allows to find trends to establish data about what ideas around gender, sexuality, class, etc.

All of these different sites collect data. Data mining sources: web data, user behavioural data, social media, personal data (health apps, geo-location).

Example: browser extension that shows trackers.

### Google
- Google not only tracks information about what you search, but also a trove of behavioural data to collect a personal "image" of you
- For example, based on your use of Google's search engines and email, how do you think they could determine different information about you?
    - Age, sexual pref, health info, planning to do in the future?



What makes you question them or trust them? For example, why do we even still continue to use Facebook when we know that they are collecting and storing all of our data? What about store 'loyalty cards'?

Need to create data for our ads, etc. 

Google Chrome should be classified as spyware. 11,000 datapoints / trackers

> "You're not the consumer, you're the product"

idea of sacraficing data.

This is not an innocent practice. They are collecting data as a speak for us to marketers, businesses and corperations. It speaks "as if" it's accurate and definitive. It says a little bit of who we are, etc. There are many articles about how we have been misinterpereted.

Data brokers are companies that store, collect, and package personal data from you (eg. apps, programs, websites), combine it with other information about you, and sell it to companies that want to know more about you.

Data brokers become dangerous when informations begins to combine, such as a company like Axium. They'll aggregate the data, they can isolate patterns, ie. alcoholics.

Liphold: the danger lies in the ways that data analytic companies sort you into marketable categories: potential hinheritor, adult with senior parent, middle-aged diabetes, alcoholic with money issues.

## Activity: What protections do we have?
[Data Brokers: A Look at the Canadian and American Landscape](https://www.priv.gc.ca/media/1778/db_201409_e.pdf)

Can request information, etc. on data has on us, greyzones, data brokers still exist.
