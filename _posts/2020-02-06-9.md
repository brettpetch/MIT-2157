Access and Reccomendation

Last Class, we talked about rhetoric of personalization. There is this promise and hype that they're personalized and are doing so many things to show us what we want. Last day when we talked about Netflix, we don't want to know why they're providing that content. There's this promise that they are tailored to us.

> "There are 33 million different versions of Netflix"
- Joris Evers, Director of Global Communications

We're going to look at this, and Bandersnatch is the idea that we don't always get what we want. Big data systems don't always deliver.

This personalization enables Netflix's analysis of vast quantities of customer data, generated by monitoring user's responses. The data collected includes: Starting and pausing films, rewinding, selections. They'll also look at how we select, what we add to our wish lists. They're never really providing it in the way that we want. Netflix emphasises this personalization. 

What Netflix is really trying to do is model behaviour through data. This makes it possible to measure future preferences, attitudes and behaviours without motivations, speeches, or interests, but on data. What Netflix is trying to do is: How do we determine what people like? One of the interesting things that Netflix CEO has said is "if you watch the Goop Lab 10 times a year, it's more in your interest". We can uncover this truth through data reference. 

In House of Cards, they claimed they had data on what people wanted. They choose this as their first landmark Television show. Spent $100 million to produce 2 seasons. Based on user data. They immediately jumped on this, attached themselves to this. Critics then realized that Netflix would be able to craft techniques to push us to where they want us to go. Because they have all of this user data, etc. It's not based on what our preferences are, but rather because they're trying to manipulate our data.

They're trying to understand userdata, find out what we want. This behaviour data is used to keep audiences watching. What keeps people coming back to Netflix? Now, a video on Netflix Reccomendation and the porn industry.
