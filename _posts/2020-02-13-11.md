Background: youth, big data and health information.

Good morning, I was expecting to be able to interact wiht the class today. Wheelhouse: Health, healthcare and how big data interact. To begin, I'd like to start with health and healthcare and how we make it in society. How many of you have interacted with the healthcare system? What kind of healthcare: pharmacies, routine family doctors, cardiac units, trying to get into system. Has anyone ever: gone to a clinic? All of these are **social accomplishment**, meaning that people, values and belief are implicated. Healthcare is a sociotechnological approach, and they either work together, or they fail miserably.

Today, we will concerns around health and healthcare, reflect on ethical and technological challenges and big data. So, what do you think that health means?
- Overall wellbeing: physical, emotional.

Health is the absence of disease, but rather about allowing people to live their lives. This is the sociological model, where we move from individual to public policy. We look at how policies operate, and all of those impact and determine wellbeing and influence how illness is treated. In canada, we have 15 different healthcare systems. There are also different layers of this. [horrible diagram]: its's how insttutions are staffed, funded and solved in different contexts. Each of these collects information constantly and holds potential to better serve its users. 

What happens when one plate changes, it's not an easy solution, but a complex scenario.

## Health Disparities
We assume that health is a fundamental right and is seen in greater or lesser extent between populations. Influences of this may be race, ethnicity, etc.

## Ethics
At any of these, do you see profit? Not here in Canada. When we think about big data, machine learning and what is happening currently, this is about peoples lives, and is a guiding system that should take precident above others.
1. Non-maleficence: Do no harm or act in malice.
2. Beneficence: ensuring you are benefiting the individual. Don't waste resources: don't collect info you don't need, etc.
3. Health maximisation: 
4. Efficiency: 
5. Respectful for autonomy: respect that the person has the right to choose.
6. Justice: 
7. Proportionality: Intervention (vaccine for example), they gain from the hurt. Ideally, it would be at play at every part of the journey.

## Big Data & Computer Science
It's really related to the developments that could be done through technology. Most of the time, there is a dataset that is too big for humans to comprehend. I think it's fair to say the guiding compass of big data and how it is employed in advances of analytic needs wil come from technological change. It will be far more comprehensive than other traditional info.

### Big Data 'Revolution'
- advances in analytic tecch in comp sciences.
- linked changes in other industries
- constast to traditional statistical networks
- 80% of data exists in an unstructured format.

> Advances in computer science will always shape big datai n healthcare
> Should the values orientaitions of other industries drive healthcare?

It would not only make more efficient, but also more effective. 

## A Revolution? 
The growth in data has raised to Exabytes (EB): 1 billion gigabytes.
Concerns with big data: privacy laws can't keep up with the speed we are creating the data. Healthcare has always been very complex and slow-moving. Even before this revolution started, questions have been burning. Who's concerns are in big data. 

I want to talk about the framework: You used the word 'consumer' a few minutes ago, instead of 'service user', 'patient'. The way healthcare has been driven is through leveraging the collection of patient data as a way to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare AND towards predictive medicine. We talk about extracting, mining, extracintg, donating and assets. If you need higher degrees of computation, only some people have access to it. 

## Big Data and Health:
Who gets to own it, who oversees the algorithm used and will it( do the right thing? Where is our health data? How do issues of privacy and big data intersect? If we were to transfer isms into the data. 
![Data Conundrum](https://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Healthcares-Data-Conundrum-Infographic.png)

## What do we man by health data?
Who's vaccinated, lab info systems, diagnostic imaging repos, drug info systems, privacy clinical...

## The invididual vs the aggregate
If we take many persons and aggregate it, will get a very important picture of what is needed in data. The issue with this is that if the data is faulty. Aggregates can exclude

Digital Divide: collecting immunization info, etc. there are people who don't have a device. We are building this aggregate portrayal without people. This is like walking the world with one eye closed. Exclusion is of a digital divide. I don't know about your grandma, people who avoid engaging with technology. This is a step across from the digital divide. Much less representative of the digital divide. Additionally, aggregates can exclude through minority groups: nymwars - native americans signing up, their name was being excluded. When you looked at the name accuracy of Facebook, it was 2% of the population was being excluded. Another way prediction can be different: using the past ot predict the future. Data gathering as a social accomplishment. This talks about millions of black people being affected by racial bias by algorithm. Study: Black person, white person, same complex diagnosis and tracked how they go through healthcare. They're being prescribed differently, etc. racialized populations have received less healthcare, been prescribed differently, etc. How data has been gathered differently all along. We're bringing along our isms into the new sphere.

That is not to say that there aren't very interesting capabilities. In Paris, they looked at every form of data in the hospital was for 15 years. Now, there is a web interface and look at what it would be like on valentines day on a friday. Staff differently, etc. be prepared for events. This predictive capability became super important in delivering care.

## Spurious Correlations:
Large amounts of data, correlation between correlation: Ice cream sales up, polio cases up: human interpretation of data...

> Big data offers the potential to create an observational evidence base for clinical questions. 

Fairly good surgery, etc. using forms, just code into a system, collect info. Now, big data analytics can dive into what the nurses reported after the doctor left. Served to predict better.

## Big data and your medical information
It's not only going to be attractive, but rather the organizations that are more likely to use it are not going to be healthcare info. Walmart had an app that would track employees health, etc. 

Through big data analytics, etc. when women starts buying cocoa butter, stops buying pills, etc. A pregnant consumer is a high value consumer. Target noticed that if there is possibility a person was pregnant, her pregnancy was outed to her family before she knew was pregnant. Was an intrusion on her family, etc. Not a corperate concern. We are starting to see the notion that period tracking apps are not for women. Tracking your own lifestyle is not only just damaging in that way, but the implication by our health. 

The right choices: some people are unable to pay for high... big data continues to individualise, etc. make things larger.
