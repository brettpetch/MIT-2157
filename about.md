# Planet Google: Big Data and the Information Society
### Zak Bronson
#### Course Description
Discover how access to and control of behind-the-scenes information is a major force in our lives. This course explores how search engines harvest “big” data from users and use it to map, analyze, and exploit patterns of online behaviour for marketing, government and corporate intelligence, and other purposes.
By taking this course, students will:
- Comprehend the theoretical principles that underlie key concepts of large-scale data systems, including algorithms, predictive analytics, linked data, and metadata
- Recognize key continuities and differences between the various paradigms of data that prevail in modern technological discourse, and place these paradigms in an historical and social context
- Critically engage with statements in the popular and professional media related to big data, and in so doing distinguish fact from fiction, and truth from hype
- Communicate both their understanding and their critical engagement to organizations and individuals that would benefit from this knowledge, and be in a position to reward from it
